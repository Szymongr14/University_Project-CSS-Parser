# CSS parser in C++

This project was completed as part of my algorithm and data structures course, where I was tasked with implementing various data structures without the use of the STL library. These structures included a custom vector, string, and linked list.


## Operation of the application
The main goal of this project was to create a simple CSS processing engine. The engine takes in CSS sections interspersed with command sections from standard input and parses them accordingly. CSS declarations are read and placed in appropriate structures, while command sections are parsed and executed. Any resulting output (after "==") is then printed to standard output.

## Sample input
